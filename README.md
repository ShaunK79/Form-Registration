# Form-Registration
A registration form in HTML and CSS

Using only HTML and CSS i created a simple registration form from my learning where the following elements/ properties were used:

- *Form* An HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing
- *Fieldset* The fieldset tag is used to group related elements in a form.
        The fieldset tag draws a box around the related elements
- *Label* The label tag defines a label for several elements
- *Input* The input tag specifies an input field where the user can enter data.
                The input element is the most important form element.
                The input element can be displayed in several ways, depending on the type attribute
- *Select* The select element is used to create a drop-down list.
            The select element is most often used in a form, to collect user input
- *Option* The option tag defines an option in a select list.
            <option> elements go inside a <select>, <optgroup>, or <datalist> element
- *textarea* The <textarea> tag defines a multi-line text input control

With the CSS it was about styling the fonts, background colour, input/ fieldsets, some Hover affects - cursor = pointer, submit button

I also created an another html & css files for the terms and conditions and linked the index to this.
